> Original educational notes inspired by topics covered in *System Design Interview – An Insider’s Guide* Volumes 1 and 2 (Alex Xu; Volume 2 also credits Sahn Lam). These are independent explanations and exercises, **not copied book chapters or diagrams**.

## Core Idea

Cover chunked uploads, metadata service, file versioning, sync notifications, conflict resolution and storage lifecycle.

## Architecture and Trade-offs

Delta sync saves bandwidth but needs stable version tracking. Concurrent edits require explicit conflict semantics.

## Design Checklist

1. Clarify functional and non-functional requirements.
2. Identify critical data entities, APIs and data flow.
3. State scale estimates and assumptions.
4. Explain bottlenecks, failures, security and observability.
5. Compare alternatives and justify the selected design.

## Practice Exercise

Design file sync across two offline laptops.

## Senior-Level Interview Questions

- Which failure modes would break this design first?
- What would you measure to validate its scalability?
- Which consistency and latency guarantees can it actually provide?
- How would you migrate an existing production system safely?

## Further Study

Add an original architecture diagram, capacity estimate and runnable experiment.
